# üöÄ Complete Railway Deployment Guide for TravelBuddy

## ‚úÖ What We've Accomplished So Far

1. ‚úÖ **Created Dockerfile** - Optimized for Spring Boot WAR deployment
2. ‚úÖ **Built WAR file** - Successfully packaged your application
3. ‚úÖ **Tested Docker locally** - Container runs correctly on port 8080
4. ‚úÖ **Production configuration** - Separate prod profile for Railway
5. ‚úÖ **Railway configuration** - railway.toml file ready

## üéØ Next Steps: Deploy to Railway

### Step 1: Install Git (Required for Railway)

1. **Download Git:**
   - Go to: https://git-scm.com/download/win
   - Download "64-bit Git for Windows Setup"
   - Install with default settings

2. **Verify Installation:**
   ```powershell
   git --version
   ```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub:**
   - Visit: https://github.com
   - Sign in to your account
   - Click "New repository" (green button)

2. **Repository Settings:**
   - Repository name: `travelbuddy-app`
   - Description: `Spring Boot Travel Booking Application`
   - Set to **Public** (required for Railway free tier)
   - ‚úÖ Add a README file
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Copy the repository URL** (you'll need this)

### Step 3: Push Code to GitHub

Open PowerShell in your project directory and run:

```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
Set-Location "c:\Users\chait\OneDrive\Desktop\sample\TravelBuddy"

# Initialize Git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Spring Boot WAR application with Docker"

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Add your GitHub repository (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/travelbuddy-app.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Create Railway Account & Project

1. **Sign up for Railway:**
   - Go to: https://railway.app
   - Click "Login" ‚Üí "Login with GitHub"
   - Authorize Railway to access your GitHub

2. **Create New Project:**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your `travelbuddy-app` repository
   - Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile

### Step 5: Add MySQL Database

1. **In Railway Dashboard:**
   - Click "New Service" (+ button)
   - Select "Database"
   - Choose "MySQL"
   - Railway will provision a MySQL instance

2. **Wait for Database Setup:**
   - MySQL service will show "Deploying" then "Active"
   - Note the database connection details

### Step 6: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Click on your App Service** (not the MySQL service)
2. **Go to "Variables" tab**
3. **Add these environment variables:**

```
DATABASE_URL = jdbc:mysql://${{MySQL.MYSQL_PRIVATE_URL}}/travelbuddy
DATABASE_USERNAME = ${{MySQL.MYSQL_USER}}
DATABASE_PASSWORD = ${{MySQL.MYSQL_PASSWORD}}
PORT = 8080
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE = prod
```

**Important Notes:**
- Use `${{MySQL.MYSQL_PRIVATE_URL}}` (Railway will replace this automatically)
- The database name `travelbuddy` will be created automatically
- Don't use quotes around the values

### Step 7: Deploy Application

1. **Trigger Deployment:**
   - Railway automatically deploys when you push to GitHub
   - Or click "Deploy" in Railway dashboard

2. **Monitor Deployment:**
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Watch the build logs
   - Deployment takes 3-5 minutes

3. **Check Application Status:**
   - Service should show "Active" status
   - Click on the service to see the public URL

### Step 8: Access Your Application

1. **Get Public URL:**
   - In Railway dashboard, click your app service
   - Go to "Settings" tab
   - Find "Public Networking" section
   - Copy the generated URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)

2. **Test Your Application:**
   - Open the URL in browser
   - You should see your TravelBuddy homepage
   - Test login, registration, and booking features

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Build Fails
**Solution:**
- Check that `target/TravelBuddy-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war` exists
- Rebuild locally: `./mvnw clean package -DskipTests`
- Push changes to GitHub

### Issue 2: Database Connection Error
**Solution:**
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Check MySQL service is "Active"
- Ensure database URL format is correct

### Issue 3: Application Won't Start
**Solution:**
- Check deployment logs in Railway dashboard
- Verify Dockerfile syntax
- Ensure WAR file is in correct location

### Issue 4: 404 Error on Pages
**Solution:**
- Check JSP files are in `src/main/webapp/`
- Verify view resolver configuration
- Check controller mappings

## üìä Monitoring Your Application

### Railway Dashboard Features:
1. **Metrics:** CPU, Memory, Network usage
2. **Logs:** Real-time application logs
